# Yarn Blocks Mod

A lightweight and aesthetic Minecraft mod that adds **Yarn**, **Yarn Balls**, and **Yarn Blocks** in all 16 wool colors.  
Inspired by real-world knitting and crafting, this mod expands the decorative building options while keeping a vanilla-friendly feel.

## ✨ Features

### 🧶 Yarn Balls
- A new crafting material obtained by processing wool
- Color-specific: breaking down *Red Wool* gives *Red Yarn Ball*, etc.
- Used to craft Yarn Blocks (and more items are planned!)

### 🧱 Yarn Block
- A new soft-looking decorative block with a texture inspired by soft skeins of yarn
- Available in all 16 Minecraft wool colors
- Works similarly to wool (tool type, drop behavior, etc.)

**Crafting:** 9x Yarn Ball &rarr; 1 Yarn Block

## 🎨 Textures
All textures are custom-made. Each texture is designed to match the vanilla aesthetic while clearly showing the yarn-like material.

## 📦 Compatibility
- Designed for **Forge/Fabric** (depending on your implementation)

## 🛠️ Technical Overview
- Implemented in **Java** using the Minecraft modding API
- Includes custom items, blocks, loot tables, crafting recipes, and lang files
- Uses dynamic color assignment based on Minecraft’s standard wool palette

## 🚀 Roadmap
- [ ] Colored Yarn armor set (fun cosmetic) that protects from freezing
- [ ] Carpet-style “Yarn Rugs”
- [ ] Custom crafting table "spindle" where items can be crafted ("knit")
- [ ] Make yarn balls be placeable similar to candles
- [ ] Add cat-luring item from yarn balls that attracts cats
